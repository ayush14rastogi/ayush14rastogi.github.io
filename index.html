                I am having 4 years of Linux System Engineer, currenly working at Mahindra Comviva.
                <br>I am Working in Linux Enviorment and doing automation using Shell,Phython Scriting.
                <br>I have learned Python from Data Camp <a class="spl_text1"href="https://www.datacamp.com/courses/intro-to-python-for-data-science">Intro to Python for Data Science Course.</a>
                  I wanted to change my career so I started to learn  MEAN Stack Web Developer from <a class="spl_text1"href="https://edwisor.com/">Edwisor</a></p>

                As far as projects are concerned, Currently I am working on a Portfolio Website where I made 4-5 sections describing my career progress and other related interests.
    		    		I decided to build this website step by step and not directly jumping to the coding part.<br>
    		    		At the very beginning, I carefully read the question and analysed what is to develop. By keeping all the 4-5 mentioned points in the mind, I use pen and paper to highlight what to include in the Website, and try to build a rough sketch.
    		    		Then I take a look on some professional portfilio websites thoroughly and understood how to think before building something new.
    		    		I draw several samples of my web-page and then compare everyone.<br><br>
    		    		Then again I visited to several websites to check how fonts, headings, titles, images, navigation-bars, margins, etc are used on a webpage and then draw an updated template on paper including details about spacing, margins, paddings and built a rough sketch and then I collected data to be included in the website. I decide to keep everything organised from the very beginning therefore all the images, icons, logos were placed in their repective hierarchical folders.<br>
    		    		Before starting the coding part, I build a final sketch on a paper and start working according to it by keeping in mind all the responsive website elements.
    		    		On inclusion of every element, I check the responsiveness by changing the size of browser window and try to handle it efficiently.
    		    		During the development phase, I found difficulties related to multiple font sizes and bulkyness of my CSS file. It took a while for me to build it, but I think, I figured that out. I started using class and ids properly along with mediaqueries and flexbox concepts. By giving proper and logical name to every HTML element, it become easy to use CSS properties more effectively with higher efficiency.
    		    		<br><br>
    		    		On each milestone or problem arousal, I made a habbit to commit the updated code on GIT, so that  later it become easy for me to change something, and also for anyone trying understand the code with minimum efforts.
